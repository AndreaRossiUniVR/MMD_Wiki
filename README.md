UniVR Mining Massive Datasets Project 
This project involves data cleaning, feature extraction, user classification, and potentially unsupervised learning methods (like clustering). You would learn a lot about different user behavior patterns and how to detect them. It might be less straightforward to validate the results, as real-life user classes may not be well-defined or may overlap. However, this project would give you valuable experience in handling and making sense of unstructured, real-world data.
